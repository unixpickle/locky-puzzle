# locky-puzzle

This is my attempt at creating a solver for a twisty puzzle. I don't know what this puzzle is called, and I don't have physical access to it. The [photos](photos) show the puzzle with a V-perm on the yellow layer. A face can turn if all the arrows on that face point in the same rotational direction. In the solved state, opposite faces turn in opposite rotational directions (clockwise and counter-clockwise).
